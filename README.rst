HSD â€” Human-friendly Structured Data
************************************

This Python package contains utilities to read and write files in
the Human-friendly Structured Data (HSD) format.

It is licensed under the *BSD 2-clause license*.


The HSD format
==============

The HSD-format is very similar to both JSON and XML, but tries to minimize the
effort for humans to read and write it. It ommits special characters as much as
possible but (in contrast to YAML for example) is not indentation dependent.

It was developed originally developed as the input format for a scientific
simulation tool (DFTB+), but is absolutely general. A typical input written in
HSD would look like ::

  driver {
    conjugate_gradients {
      moved_atoms = 1 2 "7:19"
      max_steps = 100
    }
  }

  hamiltonian {
    dftb {
      scc = yes
      scc_tolerance = 1e-10
      mixer {
        broyden {}
      }
      filling {
        fermi {
          temperature [kelvin] = 1e-8
        }
      }
      k_points_and_weights {
        supercell_folding = {
          2   0   0
          0   2   0
          0   0   2
          0.5 0.5 0.5
        }
      }
    }
  }

Content in HSD format can be represented as JSON. Content in JSON format can be
represented as HSD, provided it satisfies a restriction for arrays: Either all
elements of an array must be objects or none of them. (This allows for a clear
separation of structure and data and allows for the very simple input format.)

Content in HSD format can be represented as XML (DOM-tree). Content in XML can
be converted to HSD, provided it satisfies the restriction that every child has
either data (text) or further children, but never both of them. (Again, this
ensures the simplicity of the input format.)
